				<h2>Rubik's Cube</h2>
				<h4>Description:</h4>
				<p id="descriptionPara">Rubik's Cube is a 3-D combination puzzle invented in 1974[1][2] by Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture Ern≈ë
					Rubik. Originally called the Magic Cube,[3] the puzzle was licensed by Rubik to be sold by Ideal Toy Corp. in 1980[4]
					via businessman Tibor Laczi and Seven Towns founder Tom Kremer,[5] and won the German Game of the Year special award
					for Best Puzzle that year. As of January 2009, 350 million cubes had been sold worldwide[6][7] making it the world's
					top-selling puzzle game.[8][9] It is widely considered to be the world's best-selling toy.[10] In a classic Rubik's
					Cube, each of the six faces is covered by nine stickers, each of one of six solid colours: white, red, blue, orange,
					green, and yellow. In currently sold models, white is opposite yellow, blue is opposite green, and orange is opposite
					red, and the red, white and blue are arranged in that order in a clockwise arrangement.[11] On early cubes, the position
					of the colours varied from cube to cube.[12] An internal pivot mechanism enables each face to turn independently, thus
					mixing up the colours. For the puzzle to be solved, each face must be returned to have only one colour. Similar puzzles
					have now been produced with various numbers of sides, dimensions, and stickers, not all of them by Rubik.</p>
